**RactiveJS + AmpersandJS**

This demo shows how to utilize <a href="http://www.ractivejs.org/" target="_blank">RactiveJS</a> views and components together with <a href="http://ampersandjs.com" target="_blank">AmpersandJS</a> models.

At <a href="http://www.advarics.net" target="_blank">advarics GmbH</a> we use both of them to develop our internal
tools and customer services.


As a performant view layer Ractive lets you decide how and by using which of the available "frameworks"
you're gonna control backend logic. And as a "non-frameworky framework" AmpersandJS is, IMHO, an ideal
choice when one wants to utilize only certain parts of a (probably) much bigger machinery to solve discrete problems.

**Info on Ractive parts**

This demo comprises of three Ractive <a href="https://github.com/ractivejs/component-spec" target="_blank">components</a>

a) Footer

b) Sidebar Menu

c) Main Panel

There's a fourth Ractive element which is not a component but rather a "normal" <a href="http://docs.ractivejs.org/latest/get-started" target="_blank">Ractive</a>.
Its tasks are creating html-tables and asynchronous communication with two web-services:

a) http://www.robohash.org

b) http://api.randomuser.me

**Info on Ampersand parts**

The logical structures of the *sidebar menu* and dynamically generated *tables* are based on AmpersandJS <a href="https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-model" target="_blank">models</a>.
The component template *t-menu.ract* in *scripts/advarics/ui* contains the model structure of the sidebar menu.
The model definitions are in *scripts/models/adv-models.js*

Tables are defined in *t-table-view.html* and their logic is located in *demo-view.js*

**Ampersand adaptor for Ractive**

To make Ractive capable of using Ampersand *models, collections and rest-collections* we have to inject a proper Adaptor into it.
In this case we need the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ractive-adaptors-ampersand" targrt="_blank">Ampersand-Adaptor</a>.
Next we have to activate the adaptor inside the Ractive which will use Ampersand objects.

*Example*

```javascript
[...]
 this.instance = new Ractive({
          el: el,
          template: require('./t-table-view.html'),
          adapt: ['Ampersand'],
          data: function() {
[...]
```

**How to run the demo**

First, install all needed node packages via npm.
```bash
npm install
```

Second, let gulp create the structure.

```bash
  gulp
```

And finally, start the local node server.

```bash
  npm start
```
